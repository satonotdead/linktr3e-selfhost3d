# Cool stuff from matenauta

Simple website that just points the audience to my projects.

&nbsp;

## Inspiration

I want something like link.tree but without the bloatware that corpos involves. So I adapted a Webflow template and exported it to HTML for upload to the cloud :)

&nbsp;

## How to use the template

1) ``git clone https://github.com/satoshinotdead/insta-links``

2) ``cd insta-links`` for editing your stuff (please, double-check the links).

3) Upload and use it!

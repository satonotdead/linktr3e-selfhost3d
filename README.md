# Cool stuff from matenauta โก

Simple website that just points the audience to my projects.

## Inspiration

link.tree without bloatware? :)

I adapted a Webflow template for use it by my own.

## How to use the template

1) ``git clone https://github.com/satoshinotdead/insta-links``

2) ``cd insta-links`` for editing your stuff (please, double-check the links).

3) Upload and use it!

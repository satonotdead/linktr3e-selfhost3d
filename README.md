# Cool stuff from matenauta (link.tree self-hosted)

Simple website that just points audience to my projects.

I get inspiration from **link.tree** without bloatware, tracking and overprice (ğŸ¤«)

## How to use it

1) ``git clone https://github.com/satoshinotdead/insta-links``

2) ``cd insta-links`` for editing your stuff (please, double-check the links).

3) Upload and use!

> You can use Github Pages using a simple script on Github Actions too ğŸ§¡
